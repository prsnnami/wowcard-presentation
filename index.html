    <em>AR</em>?
  </div>
  <div>
    <em>Augmented Reality</em> brings components of the digital world into a person's perception of the real world, and does so not as a simple display of data, but through the integration of immersive sensations that are perceived as natural parts of an environment. 
  </div>
  <div>
    It is used to <em>enhance</em> the natural environments or situations and offer perceptually enriched experiences. With the help of advanced AR technologies (e.g. adding computer vision and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulable.
